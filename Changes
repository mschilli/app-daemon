Revision history for Perl extension App::Daemon.

0.09 (not yet released)
    (ms) Fixed find_option example on manual page. Thanks to 
         Rolf Schaufelberger for pointing it out.

0.08 (11/05/2009)
    (ms) [RT 50884] Applied patch by Matthew Byng-Maddick allow overriding
         app-internal option settings by command line options. Order is now:
         command line > app-internal > App::Daemon internal
    (ms) [RT 51066] Applied patch by Mike Whitaker to point stdin/out/err 
         to /dev/null instead of closing them.

0.07 (10/08/2009)
    (ms) Applied patch by Sadrak [rt:44513] to check if Log4perl has
         already been initialized and skip the easy_init call in this
         case. Note that -v then has to be handled by the user-provided 
         Log4perl configuration instead.

         by untainting the string obtained by appname().
